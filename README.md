If you do not know what proxies are, proxies are an intermediary server that retrieves data from an Internet source, such as a web page, on behalf of a user. They act as additional data security boundaries protecting users from malicious activity on the internet. Here, they are used to browse unreachable or blocked websites.

To find a TON more school sites, then look at this amazing open source list of proxies, security browsers, and gums, available at https://github.com/wea-f/ByePassHub/blob/main/games.md#table-of-contents

Some other fast proxies(servers sometimes may be on and off)
